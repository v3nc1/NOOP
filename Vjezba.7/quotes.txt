Difficult roads often leads to beautiful destinations.
If you feel like giving up, look back at how far you've come.
One day or day one. You decide.
Magic is believing in  yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen!
Truth, and goodness, and beauty are but different faces of the same all.
There is no greatness where there is no simplicity, goodness and truth.
Diligence is the mother of good fortune.
It does not matter how slowly you go as you do not stop.
